##  DataShift Spree

Import and Export Spree E-Commerce models through .xls or CSV  files, including all associations.

Create and assign images, taxons, properties, shipping categories, tax categories and more through single spreadsheet.

### Versions

This release has been tested against Spree 3.1 and Spree 4

## Installation

Requires datashift.

Add to bundle :

    gem 'datashift'
    gem 'datashift_spree'

Most functionality provided via command line tools, so create a high level .thor file 

thor will search root or lib/tasks so for example you can place it in `lib/tasks/shop.thor`

And then copy in the following

```ruby

# You may/may not need this next line depending on your Rails/thor setup
require File.expand_path('config/environment.rb')

require 'datashift'
require 'datashift_spree'

DataShift::load_commands
DatashiftSpree::load_commands
```

To check the available tasks run thor list with a search term, for example

```ruby
    bundle exec thor list datashift
    bundle exec thor list datashift_spree
```
To check latest usage information use ```thor help <command>```

for example

```ruby
    bundle exec thor help datashift_spree:load:products
```

### Usage

##### Template Generation

For loading data, probably the first thing you'll want to do is create an Excel template for the model(s) you wish to import. There is a general task `datashift:generate:excel` ( or ```datashift:generate:csv ```) for generating a template for any model.

There is a task available for producing the template for loading a basic Spree Product :

```ruby
thor datashift_spree:template:product -t tmp/product_template.xls
```

To generate the full Product template including all possible associations :

```ruby
thor datashift_spree:template:full -t tmp/full_product_template.xls
```

A large number of example Spreadsheets with headers and comments, can be found in the **spec/fixtures** directory - including .xls and csv versions for simple Products or complex Products with multiple/nested Taxons, Variants, Properties etc 

Excel versions contain column headings with **Comments ** with instructions on supported syntax for each column. 

The same DSL syntax is supported in both Excel and CSV versions.

To get detailed information on the impact/usage of each column see the [Spree guides](https://guides.spreecommerce.org) 

For example to understand the `promotionable` field see . https://guides.spreecommerce.org/user/promotions/


##### Data Import/Export

Once you have data prepared you can import it using task `thor datashift_spree:load:products` : 

Details

```
thor datashift_spree:load:products

  -i, --input=INPUT                            # The import file (.xls or .csv)
  -s, [--sku-prefix=SKU_PREFIX]                # Prefix to add to each SKU before saving Product
  -p, [--image-path-prefix=IMAGE_PATH_PREFIX]  # Prefix to add to image path for importing from disk
  -v, [--verbose], [--no-verbose]              # Verbose logging
  -c, [--config=CONFIG]                        # Configuration file containg defaults or over rides in YAML
  -d, [--dummy], [--no-dummy]                  # Dummy run, do not actually save Image or Product
```

```ruby
thor datashift_spree:load:products -v -d -i tmp/product_template.xls
```

Dummy Run is very useful to drive out any issues without actually impacting the database. All changes are rolled back.

A summary of the import is printed to the console,and incase of errors the datashift log ('log/datashift.log') will contain full details.

For example, not setting compulsory fields would show up as :

```Save Error : #<ActiveRecord::RecordInvalid: Validation failed: Shipping Category can't be blank, Price can't be blank> on DataShift::LoadObject
E, [2020-02-13T12:12:31.469743 #24410] ERROR -- : Failure(s) reported :
E, [2020-02-13T12:12:31.469757 #24410] ERROR -- : 	Shipping Category can't be blank
E, [2020-02-13T12:12:31.469762 #24410] ERROR -- : 	Price can't be blank
```

##### Product

###### Variants and Options on a Product

**Variant Prices/SKUs**

To assign different SKUs or Prices to each variant, datashift supports two special columns

    variant_price
    variant_sku

These should contain pipe '|' delimited lists of the prices, or SKUs, to assign, to each Variant available, and should therefor **contain exactly the same number of entries as Variants available**.

**N.B** These columns should come AFTER the Variant creation columns, as the Variants must exists at the time these columns are processed.

Example

```
    variant_price	                 variant_sku
-------------------------------------------------
171.56|260.44|171.56|260.44     ARR.SFOP424EW0|TARR.SFOP424EW3|TARR.SFOP414EW0|TARR.SFOP414EW3     
119.33|208.23	                MOLE.SFOP140EA0|MOLE.SFOP140EA3
110.00|198.00	                TALL.SFOP140EW0|TALL.SFOP140EW3
54.89|109.78|69.24              CHET.SFOP128EW3|CHET.SFOP140EW0|CHET.SFOP140EW3
42.22	                        LOST.REDL218EW0
```

##### Stock

Use a column called count_on_hand to manage initial stock levels of a product or variants on a Product

> **N.B** We don't yet have smart ordering of columns  - so these columns should come AFTER the Variant creation columns, 
as the Variants must exists when these columns are processed.
 
 For a simple single Product just specify the stock level as an integer 
 
   ```
   count_on_hand
   -------------
   13
   ```
   
This will use the default stock location. YOu can use the ':' delimiter to also set the stock_location name in form :
  
     ```
     count_on_hand
     -------------
     stock_location_name:13
     ```
   
To specify different stock levels for multiple variants use the pipe '|' to delimit each stock entry.

Currently expects the **same number of stock entries as variants**, that is we only support 1 stock entry per variant.

However you can still specify the single stock location if non default.

     ```
     Variants                       count_on_hand
     -----------------------------------------------
     size:small, medium, large        12|shop:6|7
     ```
   
Three variants by option type size,  with three different stock levels.
   

###### Creating Association data - Excel or CSV


## Testing

We use RSpec, so tests located in the spec subdirectory.

This is a Rail engine so to test this gem requires an actual Spree store, so there is a dummy Rails app
with a Gemfile pointing to a Spree store. 

The versions of Rails, Spree and Datashift to test can be controlled in `spec/dummy/Gemfile`

Edit `spec/dummy/Gemfile` and set the version of Spree you wish to test against and run bundler :

```ruby 
    cd spec/dummy
    bundle install
```

When changing Spree versions, you might need to force a Spree reinstallm in a clean dummy area.

```ruby 
    rm -rf spec/dummy/spree_sandbox_installed.txt
```

This will trigger an installation.

The next time you run rspec the sandbox will be regenerated using the latest versions of Rails/Spree specified in your Gemfile

##### Manual Spree Install

```ruby 
    cd spec/dummy
    bundle install
    bundle exec rails g spree:install --force --user_class=Spree::User --sample=false --seed=false --copy_storefront=false
```
